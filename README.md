Hi, everyoneðŸ‘‹

Thanks for your reading.

I am Oleksandr Guzenko, a **SENIOR FULL-STACK DEVELOPER** , from Ukraine.

As a Front-end & Full Stack developer, I am currently looking for a new job.
# Success is my first guide to life and business.

As a front-end developer, I develop pixel-perfect and full-screen responsive pages with state-of-the-art UI/UX components and colorful, dynamic animations.
Build modular component-based functionality across the front end of your web application and leverage current coding practices such as component architectures, functional programming patterns that focus on code quality.

âœ“ Frontend
```
â˜… HTML/CSS/JavaScript/TypeScript
â˜… Bootstrap/Tailwind CSS/Material UI/Vue Store UI, Vuetify, etc.
â˜… React/Next.js, Vue.js/Nuxt.js
â˜… GraphQL, Restful API
```
âœ“ Backend
```
â˜… Node.js, Express.JS, Python

React, HTML, CSS, JavaScript and Figma are my main skills.
So I can understand your business quickly and do a good job.
I can work more than 40 hours per week and if I want more, I can work full time with no weekend breaks. Also, my communication is very fast, so I can reply to your messages in a short time.
Looking forward to working on your project and bringing it to life!
